## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.17 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenRouter API key (sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ragekh/etsy-generators.git
   cd etsy-generators
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with your OpenRouter API key:
   ```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   PORT=5001
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

## Running Locally

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   The backend server will run on http://localhost:5001

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment

1. Set up environment variables on your hosting platform:
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key
   - `PORT`: The port to run the server on (often set by the hosting platform)
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"

2. Deploy the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Deployment

1. Build the frontend for production:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Alternatively, you can deploy the frontend to Vercel:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## Environment Variables

### Backend

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key
- `PORT`: The port to run the server on (default: 5001)
- `NODE_ENV`: The environment to run the server in (development/production)

### Frontend

- No environment variables are required for the frontend in development.
- For production, you may need to set the backend API URL if it's different from the default.

## Customizing AI Prompts

The AI prompts used by the generators are defined in the route files in the `backend/routes` directory. Each generator has its own route file with a specific prompt.

### Checking Prompts

To check the current prompts:

1. Navigate to the `backend/routes` directory
2. Open the route file for the generator you want to check:
   - `shop-name.js` - Shop Name Generator
   - `description.js` - Product Description Generator
   - `keywords.js` - Product Keywords Generator
   - `title.js` - Listing Title Generator
   - `customer-response.js` - Customer Response Generator
   - `shop-bio.js` - Shop Bio Generator
   - `promotion.js` - Promotion Text Generator
   - `announcement.js` - Shop Announcement Generator

3. Look for the `prompt` variable in each file, which contains the text sent to the AI model.

Example from `shop-name.js`:
```javascript
const prompt = `You are an expert in naming businesses, especially Etsy shops. Generate 5-10 unique, catchy, and memorable shop names for an Etsy shop focused on "${keywords}". List each name on a new line.`;
```

### Editing Prompts

To modify a prompt:

1. Open the route file for the generator you want to modify
2. Edit the `prompt` string to change the instructions given to the AI model
3. Save the file and restart the backend server for the changes to take effect

When editing prompts, keep in mind:
- Be specific about the format you want the AI to return
- Include any special instructions about style, tone, or formatting
- Maintain the template variables (like `${keywords}`, `${productName}`, etc.) that are replaced with user input
